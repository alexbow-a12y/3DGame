3D Game Assignemnt - 2/6/26

Description: 
This gane was inspired by Minecraft platformers and the game "Getting Over it." Its very short with only 4 sections, a balancy beam section, a non-sticky moving platform section, a technical small platorm area, and then a repetitive lightpole section. I changed the characters jump to be lower, the turning speed to be higher, movement speed lower, and the gravity to be higher. This is becuase I wanted this platformer to be skill based and require accuracy to complete. I spaced the platforms in a way that would make it challenging but still fun.
